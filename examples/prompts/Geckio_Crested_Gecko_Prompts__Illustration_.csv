geckio_crested_base_braun_beige,"Natural‑science illustration of a crested gecko (Correlophus ciliatus) in wild‑type brown‑to‑beige base tones, ranging from pale sand to deep cocoa; low‑contrast lateral mottling, optional faint tiger banding only. 3/4 side profile perched on a natural cork bark branch; eyelash‑like crests and dorsal ridge crisp; granular matte skin texture visible; vertical pupils; mouth closed; five toes per foot with lamellae subtly hinted. Soft daylight, matte paper rendering, shallow depth, warm neutral background with faint defocused terrarium greens; no harsh rim light. Avoid: text, watermarks, glare, neon hues, blue/green cast, exaggerated cartoon look, extra limbs/eyes/tails.",4:3,Illustration
geckio_crested_base_rot_orange,"Natural‑science illustration of a crested gecko with a warm red‑to‑orange base (terracotta through vivid orange) and minimal cream; smooth, saturated body tone without flame/harlequin contrast. 3/4 side profile on cork bark; crest (‘eyelashes’) and dorsal ridge well defined; granular matte skin; vertical pupils, mouth closed, correct toe count. Soft daylight, matte paper feel, shallow depth; warm beige background with subtle green bokeh; realistic biology and proportions. Avoid: text, watermarks, thick outline, plastic gloss, extra toes/eyes, extreme patterns.",4:3,Illustration
geckio_crested_base_gelb,"Natural‑science illustration of a crested gecko with a yellow base from pale cream to luminous yellow, neutral undertone (not orange); subtle freckling acceptable; overall low contrast. 3/4 side profile on a cork branch; eyelash crests sharp; dorsal ridge continuous; fine matte granular skin; vertical pupils; mouth closed; correct digits. Soft daylight, matte paper, shallow depth; neutral warm background, faint defocused foliage for separation. Avoid: text, watermarks, orange/red cast, glossy sheen, exaggerated cartoon features, extra limbs/eyes.",4:3,Illustration
geckio_crested_base_grau,"Natural‑science illustration of a crested gecko in cool grey base tones (light ash to charcoal) with neutral hue; very subtle mottling only; no blue or green shift. 3/4 side profile on cork bark; eyelash crests and dorsal ridge crisp; granular matte skin texture; vertical pupils; mouth closed; accurate toe anatomy. Soft daylight, matte paper style, shallow depth; cool beige‑grey background with gentle bokeh. Avoid: text, watermarks, color casts, heavy contrast patterns, wet/plastic gloss, extra limbs/eyes.",4:3,Illustration
geckio_crested_base_fast_weiss,"Natural‑science illustration of a crested gecko with near‑white ivory base (almost white), minimal visible pattern; soft form shadows preserve volume; crest edges and eye rims delicately defined so the body reads very pale. 3/4 side profile perched on cork bark; matte fine skin texture; vertical pupils; mouth closed; proper digits. Soft daylight, matte paper finish, shallow depth; nearly white warm background with faint green bokeh for separation. Avoid: text, watermarks, blown highlights, harsh outlines, plastic shine, extra limbs/eyes/tails.",4:3,Illustration
geckio_crested_variant_flame,"Natural‑science illustration of a crested gecko with rich red/orange base and distinct cream ‘flames’ rising from the lateral sides toward the dorsal; dorsal slightly darker; head and crest well defined; pattern remains organic and plausible. 3/4 side profile on cork bark; matte granular skin; vertical pupils; mouth closed; correct toe and tail anatomy. Soft daylight, matte paper rendering, shallow depth; warm neutral background with defocused foliage. Avoid: text, watermarks, muddy browns, over‑stylized geometric flames, high gloss, extra limbs/eyes.",4:3,Illustration
geckio_crested_variant_harlequin,"Natural‑science illustration of a crested gecko with high‑contrast harlequin pattern: bold cream markings on sides, limbs, and tail over a saturated red/orange/brown base; strong but natural contrast; pattern extends onto legs. 3/4 side profile on cork bark; eyelash crests pronounced; matte granular skin; vertical pupils; mouth closed. Soft daylight, matte paper, shallow depth; neutral warm background with slight green bokeh; scientific accuracy prioritized. Avoid: text, watermarks, rigid geometric blocks, excessive limb pattern beyond plausibility, plastic gloss, extra limbs/eyes.",4:3,Illustration
geckio_crested_variant_lilly_white,"Natural‑science illustration of a crested gecko showing the Lilly White phenotype: extreme high‑white coverage on dorsal and lateral areas with minimal colored islands; elegant near‑white appearance while preserving subtle form shading; crest and eye edges gently defined. 3/4 side profile on cork bark; matte fine skin; vertical pupils; mouth closed; accurate digits and tail. Soft daylight, matte paper, shallow depth; near‑white warm background with faint foliage bokeh. Avoid: text, watermarks, blown‑out pure white, harsh outlines, plastic gloss, extra limbs/eyes.",4:3,Illustration
geckio_crested_variant_dalmatian,"Natural‑science illustration of a crested gecko with light base (cream/yellow/tan) covered by clearly defined black spots of varying sizes (Dalmatian); spots crisp, organic, distributed across body and tail; no red spotting. 3/4 side profile on cork bark; eyelash crests clear; matte granular skin; vertical pupils; mouth closed; correct digits. Soft daylight, matte paper render, shallow depth; warm neutral background with soft green bokeh; realistic proportions. Avoid: text, watermarks, smeared dots, red spots, glossy plastic look, extra limbs/eyes.",4:3,Illustration
geckio_crested_variant_tiger,"Natural‑science illustration of a crested gecko with classic tiger pattern: vertical banding across body and tail over a brown/beige/yellow base; bands distinct yet organic; head and dorsal ridge sharply defined; limbs show subtle continuation of bands. 3/4 side profile on cork bark; matte granular skin; vertical pupils; mouth closed; correct toe and tail anatomy. Soft daylight, matte paper finish, shallow depth; neutral warm background with faint defocused leaves. Avoid: text, watermarks, horizontal stripes, neon hues, glossy sheen, extra limbs/eyes.",4:3,Illustration
